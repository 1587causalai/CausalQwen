## Key Mathematical Concepts

### The Four Axioms of CausalEngine

1. **Intelligence = Abduction + Action**: From observations to self-understanding to decisions
2. **Cauchy Mathematics**: The only distribution enabling analytical causal computation
3. **Temperature-Unified Control**: Single parameter controlling determinism vs stochasticity  
4. **Structural Equation Decisions**: Every choice computed by deterministic functions

### Core Mathematical Framework

The CausalEngine algorithm is built on the structural equation:

```
Y = f(U, Œµ)
```

Where:
- **U**: Individual causal representation (learned from context X)
- **Œµ**: Exogenous noise (independent random perturbation) 
- **f**: Universal causal mechanism (deterministic function)

### Two-Stage Architecture

1. **Abduction Stage**: `X ‚Üí U` (Evidence to Individual Representation)
   - AbductionNetwork: Maps observations to causal representation
   - Uses Cauchy distribution for analytical uncertainty propagation

2. **Action Stage**: `U ‚Üí Y` (Individual to Decision)
   - ActionNetwork: Maps representation to decision potential
   - ActivationHead: Converts potential to specific outputs (classification/regression)

### Mathematical Properties

- **Analytical Computation**: No sampling required due to Cauchy properties
- **Heavy-Tail Robustness**: Natural handling of outliers and extreme events
- **Undefined Moments**: Philosophical alignment with true uncertainty
- **Scale Invariance**: Consistent behavior across different scales
