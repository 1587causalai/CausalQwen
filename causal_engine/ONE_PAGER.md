# CausalEngine: Intelligence Redefined

## What is CausalEngine?

**CausalEngine is to AI what PageRank was to search** — a fundamental algorithm that redefines an entire field.

While traditional AI learns *what* typically happens, CausalEngine understands *why* things happen.

## The Core Innovation

```
Traditional AI: X → P(Y|X) → Sample → Y
CausalEngine:   X → U → f(U,ε) → Y
```

**Translation**: Instead of predicting probabilities, we identify the individual (U), apply universal laws (f), and generate deterministic outcomes with quantified uncertainty.

## The Four Axioms

1. **Intelligence = Abduction + Action**  
   First understand "who you are", then decide "what to do"

2. **Cauchy Mathematics**  
   The only distribution that computes causation analytically

3. **Temperature Control**  
   One parameter to rule determinism vs. randomness

4. **Independent Decisions**  
   Every choice stands on its own merit (no Softmax competition)

## Why It Matters

| Traditional AI | CausalEngine |
|----------------|--------------|
| Imitates patterns | Understands causes |
| Black box | Glass box |
| Needs sampling | Pure computation |
| Zero-sum choices | Independent choices |

## The Architecture

**AbductionNetwork**: Evidence → Self-Understanding
- Independent loc_net (identity) and scale_net (uncertainty)
- Smart initialization: identity when H=C, Xavier otherwise

**ActionNetwork**: Self → Decision  
**ActivationHead**: Decision → Output

## The Code

```python
from causal_engine import CausalEngine

# Works with ANY transformer
engine = CausalEngine(hidden_size=768, vocab_size=50000)
output = engine(any_transformer_features)

# Not just prediction — causal decision with uncertainty
decision, uncertainty = output['loc_S'], output['scale_S']
```

## The Vision

Just as Google built an empire on PageRank, we're building the future of AI on CausalEngine.

Every intelligent system of tomorrow will be powered by causal reasoning, not statistical imitation.

**CausalEngine isn't just better AI. It's real AI.**
