# CausalEngine v2.0.1 Release Notes

## ðŸ”§ Minor Update: Enhanced AbductionNetwork

**Release Date**: June 19, 2025  
**Version**: 2.0.1

### What's New

#### MLP-Enhanced AbductionNetwork
The AbductionNetwork now supports optional MLP layers for more sophisticated abduction inference:

1. **Automatic Dimension Conversion**
   - When `input_size â‰  causal_size`, an MLP is automatically added
   - Seamless handling of different model architectures

2. **Complex Nonlinear Inference**
   - Add MLP layers for complex feature extraction
   - Support for various activation functions (ReLU, GELU, SiLU, etc.)
   - Configurable dropout for regularization

3. **Flexible Configuration**
   ```python
   engine = CausalEngine(
       hidden_size=1024,        # Large input
       causal_size=256,         # Compressed representation
       abduction_mlp_layers=2,  # 2-layer MLP
       abduction_mlp_hidden_ratio=2.0,  # Hidden = 2 * causal_size
       abduction_mlp_activation='gelu',
       abduction_mlp_dropout=0.1
   )
   ```

### Use Cases

- **Dimension Reduction**: Compress large transformer outputs to efficient causal representations
- **Feature Enhancement**: Extract complex patterns before causal inference
- **Model Adaptation**: Easy integration with various backbone architectures

### Backward Compatibility

âœ… Fully backward compatible. Existing code continues to work without changes.

### Performance

- MLP adds computational overhead proportional to layer count
- Typical overhead: ~2x for 1 layer, ~5x for 3 layers
- Still efficient for most practical applications
